Procrastity Belt
===========
By Brian Yan, Peter Jasko, Patrick Liao
Have you ever been assigned a serious project at school or at work? I'm sure you have.
Have you ever found yourself looking at cat pictures instead of doing that serious project? Again, I'm sure you have.
Have you ever wished for more self-control so you wouldn't procrastinate so much? If the answer is yes, then I have the solution for you.
It's called the Procrastity Belt. Procrastity Belt is a Google Chrome extension that will stop you from watching Youtube videos or going on Redit when you are supposed to be doing work.
This is done in javascript and by making use of the Alchemy API.
So remember, next time you have a big project due, but are afraid of temptation, the Procrastity Belt is here for you.
